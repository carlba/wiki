## Type declaration

* Define a variable as a string
    
    ``` typescript
    let myString: string
    ```
    
* Other types

    ``` typescript
    let myNumber: number;
    let myBoolean: boolean;
    let myArray: Array<string>:
    let anything: any;
    ```
    
* This is also infered if you assign a variable as a string
  
    ``` typescript
    let myString = 'This is my string'
    ```
    
    The type is only infered if a value is set to the varible at declaration.
